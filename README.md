# Shakuhachi Makers Tool

A modern web application for calculating precise hole positions for making traditional and diatonic shakuhachi flutes, with integrated metronome for practice.

## Features

### Shakuhachi Calculators
- **Traditional Shakuhachi Calculator (5-hole)**: Calculate hole positions for traditional shakuhachi with pentatonic scale
- **Diatonic Shakuhachi Calculator (7-hole)**: Calculate hole positions for diatonic shakuhachi with natural major scale
- **Variation Shakuhachi Calculator**: Advanced calculator with multiple maker styles including:
  - Nelson Zink formula
  - Monty Levenson approach
  - Perry Yung technique
  - Atsuya Okuda method
  - Yamaguchi variants (Katsuya, Kuroda, Kinya)
  - Kodama Hiroyuki variations
- **Physics-Based Calculations**: Environmental parameters (temperature, humidity), adjustable A frequency reference
- **Acoustic Wave Analysis**: Resonance mode analysis, standing wave patterns, micro-tuning suggestions

### Integrated Metronome
- **Speed Trainer**: Professional metronome with tempo control and patterns
- **Multiple Sound Kits**: Drum kits, tabla, electronic sounds, metronome clicks
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time tempo visualization and track patterns
- **Background/Practice Mode**: Runs independently for shakuhachi practice

### Interactive Features
- **Real-time Calculations**: See results update instantly as you modify parameters
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Comparison Tables**: Compare different maker styles side-by-side
- **Export Options**: Save calculations for reference

## About Shakuhachi

The shakuhachi is a traditional Japanese bamboo flute. This tool helps instrument makers calculate the precise positions for finger holes based on acoustic principles and ergonomic considerations.

### Traditional Shakuhachi (5-hole)
- Uses pentatonic scale intervals
- 5 finger holes plus thumb hole
- Focuses on traditional Japanese scales

### Diatonic Shakuhachi (7-hole)
- Uses diatonic scale intervals (whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half)
- 7 holes for natural major scale
- Modern adaptation for Western music
